I'm not sure why but the spaces and punctuation came back as an unrecognized symbols.
I was able to look for similarities with commonly used letters, namely vowels in this case. 
I specifically, in line 3 of the text file, it showed DOO which would
indicate that O is a vowel since no letters are commonly repeated other than vowels. 
From there, I tested a few simple keys, until (-3) gave me this.

From what I can tell, it says:
I WISH IT NEED NOT HAVE HAPPENED IN MY TIME SAID
FRODO SO DO I SAID GANDALF AND SO DO ALL WHO LIVE TO
SEE SUCH TIMES BUT THAT IS NOT FOR THEM TO DECIDE
ALL WE HAVE TO DECIDE IS WHAT TO DO WITH THE TIME
THAT IS GIVEN TO US
